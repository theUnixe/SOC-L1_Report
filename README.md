# SOC-L1_Report


Report Format

An example of good, structured report following the 5Ws approach

Imagine yourself as an L2 analyst, a DFIR team member, or an IT professional who needs to understand the alert. What would you want to see in the report? We recommend you follow the Five Ws approach and include at least these items in the report:

    Who: Which user logs in, runs the command, or downloads the file
    What: What exact action or event sequence was performed
    When: When exactly did the suspicious activity start and ended
    Where: Which device, IP, or website was involved in the alert
    Why: The most important W, the reasoning for your final verdict

At 18:30 UTC, m.boslan@tryhackme.thm (Martin Boslan, HR lead), logged in to their Google Workspace from a trusted LPT-HR-0988 device, and a minute later attempted to download the whole HR folder on their laptop, but was blocked by our DLP solution.

 A minute later, Martin shared the 'Employee Records (Updated)' spreadsheet to an unidentified shadow18562@protonmail.thm Protonmail email. Although no events are followed, escalating the alert to communicate with Martin and report the incident to the Compliance team.
